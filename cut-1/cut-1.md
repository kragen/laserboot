This is my second laser-cut thing.  This time I think I am going to
try to cut a shelving thing to put on the counter in the kitchen,
ideally adding about as much shelf space as the size of the microwave,
without blocking access to the counter underneath it.

I’m going to do it in MDF, but this time I think I will try 2mm MDF
instead of 3mm MDF; this should be a bit more than twice as flexible,
and also should be pretty easy to cut.

The MDF version is probably not going to be the final version, because
it will warp pretty badly when it gets wet, and getting wet is
inevitable for a thing that sits on the counter.

The counter space it has to fit into is 1030 mm × 455 mm, and the
counter itself is 25mm thick, which I can perhaps take advantage of at
some point.  The microwave is 493mm×390mm.

Among the things I would like to hold are:

- two bottles with a 50mm square base that has a 50mm tall rectangular
  prism part (one is stevia, and the other is vanilla)
- silverware?
- the napkin box (107×63×129 mm)
- four spice jars of some 210 mm circumference (67mm diameter)
- a tea box of 130×70×75 mm
- a 208mm-circumference bottle of oil (66mm diameter)
- a salt jar of 175mm circumference (56mm diameter)
- ten Herbalife jars of 312mm circumference (100mm diameter)

None of these things are very heavy; I think that if I can get 2mm MDF
underneath them at almost any feasible thickness then they will be
adequately supported.

The ten Herbalife jars to me suggest a 4-3-2-1 triangle, which would
be a bit over 400mm wide (let’s leave 8mm space between each one and
on the ends, for a total of 440mm) and a bit less tall.  They should
probably go furthest from the front of the counter because they’re
tallest (although I can even things up to some extent by putting
supports at different heights).  The bottle of oil and the square
bottles are a bit less tall, and then there are the spice jars, salt
jar, and tea box, which are all pretty short.  See layout.ps.
