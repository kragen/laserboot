Laser boot, cut 5: Chamfered Heckballs with beams
=================================================

This is a refinement of [Cut 4 Heckballs][2]; Heckballs is an edge-lap
construction-set design I developed based on some ideas Matt Heck
showed me in 2005 or 2006.

[2]: ../cut-4

Cut 4 came out more fragile than I wanted, and the smaller scale
didn’t help its strength the way I thought it would.  So this version
makes the following changes, which took me a couple of hours:

1. The octagon size is increased back to 100 mm across the flats
   again.

2. The array of octagons is just 4×4 this time on the theory that I
   can reduce costs that way.

3. The tabs that hold the parts together during cutting are reduced
   back down to 800 μm.

4. The divot diameter is reduced from 6 mm to 3 mm, which isn’t much
   stress relief, but also won’t weaken the pieces as much.

5. The corners of the slits are generously chamfered to ease assembly.

6. The slit opposite the elongated slit is removed, for strength and
   stiffness, because you can’t use them both at once anyway, and to
   cut down on cutting time.

7. Beams are added!  They should put octagon centers four times as far
   apart as if the octagons were just edge-lapped at their edges.
   Also, the octagons they link should be coplanar, while they would
   have been in perpendicular planes if they had been connected with
   three intermediate octagons.  The beams are a bit more area than
   the octagons.  They still won’t work for the angled constructions I
   was originally envisioning because they will collide with other
   beams, and they have sharp corners, but it’s a start.

Here are the things I still want to do but haven’t done yet:

1. Slit the scrap squares so they also work as connectable pieces.

3. The octagons and divots should be hexadecagons so their corners
   aren’t as sharp, both to reduce the stress concentration factor and
   to make them easier on your hands.

4. I’d like to add some kind of engraved “JECVALZ” logo so that
   curious people can google it.  I don’t know how much extra laser
   time that will add.

5. The engineer at Max58 suggested that maybe I should let the divot
   slope go down into the bottom of the slits instead of letting the
   slit bottom be perfectly flat, thus reducing the width of the
   divot.  Presumably after some crushing this would lead to a kind of
   Pringle shape at the bottom of the slit.

6. Sprung snap joints!  That will escape the conflict between being
   easy to assemble and not falling apart a lot better than just
   fine-tuning slit widths.  Even Tinkertoys have sprung joints,
   although without snaps; that's what the slits in the ends of
   Tinkertoy beams are for.
