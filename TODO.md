All right, so I have a first version.  Here are some things I feel the
lack of painfully:

- Tools for measuring path length in order to be able to estimate
  fabrication cost.  This first cut cost me $110.
- Tools for measuring piece area/volume in order to be able to
  estimate weight.  13 of the 15 pieces I cut in this first cut weigh
  a total of 12 grams, or about 900mg each, from which I could do some
  kind of estimate of the MDF density if I had the area.
- Tools for measuring size (calipers?), deformation (calipers?) and
  force (some kind of spring thing?).
- Characterization of the material properties of MDF.  cut-0 got me
  density of ≈700g/ℓ, 3.1mm thick, 60μm positioning repeatability,
  100μm kerf width, undetectable kerf taper, 30% swelling when wet in
  thickness and under 1% in other dimensions, and about 1%
  elongation-at-break, though other sources claim 0.5%.  Some tensile
  strength and tensile and shear moduli would be fucking great though.
- Better parametric modeling software than raw PostScript.  Maybe
  Solvespace, maybe some kind of JS thing.
- Some kind of topological optimization software.

Practical (?) problems to solve with this shit:

- a kitchen counter shelf for Vinka/me.
- a drawer for Vinka.
- a box for my notebook.
- a better dining room table for María/Fran.
- a refrigerator shelf for Débora.
- an opaque carrying case for my netbook.
- a new office chair
- a comb
- a couch
- a dining room table for the new house
- refrigerator shelves for the new house
- a spring scale
- a grabber
- a construction set
- a mechanical display
- saw blades
- a spool of thread
- a segelinbot (“sayhalene”)
- a non-bot segelin
- a gantry
- a ruler
- a slide rule
- calipers, indicators, etc.
- a wire bender
- a microengraver/microplotter
- a satchel
- pants
- a bicycle
- gears

I need to make a plan to start making stuff regularly.  I think I will
make a queue with some finished fallback things in it and fabricate a
new thing, up to a US$15 limit per day, deferrable to later days.
Buying my own laser cutter will cost US$8000, which would be at least
three years of doing one new thing each day; if I get that far (2019!)
without finding a better approach, it'll be easy to justify the
expense.

Hopefully I can start by cutting something out *tomorrow*, 2016-08-27.
Max58 is open tomorrow from 10:30 to 14:00; I want to be there at
12:00 with money and two files ready, just to be sure.  That means I
need to change money in the morning.
