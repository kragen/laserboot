All right, so I have a first version.  Here are some things I feel the
lack of painfully:

- Tools for measuring path length in order to be able to estimate
  fabrication cost.  This first cut cost me $110.
- Tools for measuring piece area/volume in order to be able to
  estimate weight.  13 of the 15 pieces I cut in this first cut weigh
  a total of 12 grams, or about 900mg each, from which I could do some
  kind of estimate of the MDF density if I had the area.
- Tools for measuring size (calipers?), deformation (calipers?) and
  force (some kind of spring thing?).
- Characterization of the material properties of MDF.  cut-0 got me
  density of ≈700g/ℓ, 3.1mm thick, 60μm positioning repeatability,
  100μm kerf width, undetectable kerf taper, 30% swelling when wet in
  thickness and under 1% in other dimensions, and about 1%
  elongation-at-break, though other sources claim 0.5%.  Some tensile
  strength and tensile and shear moduli would be fucking great though.
- Better parametric modeling software than raw PostScript.  Maybe
  Solvespace, maybe some kind of JS thing.
- Some kind of topological optimization software.

Practical problems to solve with this shit:

- a kitchen counter shelf for Vinka/me.
- a drawer for Vinka.
- a box for my notebook.
- a better dining room table for María.
- a refrigerator shelf for Débora.
- an opaque carrying case for my netbook.
- a new office chair
