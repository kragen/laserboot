All right, so I have a first version.  Here are some things I feel the
lack of painfully:

- Tools for measuring path length in order to be able to estimate
  fabrication cost.  This first cut cost me $110.
- Tools for measuring piece area/volume in order to be able to
  estimate weight.  13 of the 15 pieces I cut in this first cut weigh
  a total of 12 grams, or about 900mg each, from which I could do some
  kind of estimate of the MDF density if I had the area.
- Tools for measuring size (calipers?), deformation (calipers?) and
  force (some kind of spring thing?).
- Characterization of the material properties of MDF.
- Better parametric modeling software than raw PostScript.  Maybe
  Solvespace.
- Some kind of topological optimization software.
