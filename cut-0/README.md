This was the first cut, of laser000.ps with Max58.  This was made from
a slightly earlier (and hopefully functionally equivalent) version of
laser000.ps.

Initial results are:

- the slot is too narrow to measure what I want to measure, grabbing
  the pieces crosswise, making a super strong joint; I had to use
  pliers to pull the 20.3mm one out of the slot, damaging its surface;
- the 20.5 mm male tongue enters the 20 mm female slot successfully;
- the 20.7 mm male tongue does not enter the 20 mm female slot
  successfully;
- in the 20mm width of the hole from which the 20mm x 30mm female piece
  was removed, pieces up to 20.1mm fall out from either side, the
  20.2mm piece fits snugly from either side, the 20.3mm piece fits
  snugger, the 20.5 piece enters with great difficulty, the 20.7 mm
  piece enters with difficulty and some damage, the 20.9mm piece
  enters with force, leverage, and substantial damage, and the
  21.1mm piece enters only when it's badly torn up.
- the kerf is thicker on the front than on the back; eyeballing, I
  think it's about 300 micro-m on the front and 100 micro-m on the back, but
  I'll measure in photos shortly;
- I don't have a good handle on what corner radius is being
  achieved;
- the kerfs do not quite close on the back at a few corners
- the text marking was the slowest part; it demonstrates that the
  marking line width is on the order of 100 micro-m and precision is
  maybe 30 micro-m (again, I'll measure in photos shortly)
- the tongues do not quite reach the bottom of the cut-through slit,
  leaving a burned surface slightly recessed on the other side
- the surface-engraved slit is too shallow to fit tongues into
- there is substantial surface discoloration near the cuts from
  smoke and/or scorching, especially on the back
- the unpainted MDF discolors rapidly when I handle it with my dirty
  bus hands, although less than from the smoke
- 3mm MDF is unreasonably difficult to bend or to break with your
  hands, and I should probably use 1mm MDF or cardboard for most
  things, which should be cheaper too.
- I think I can probably do a nominally 200micro-m hole with no
  problem.
