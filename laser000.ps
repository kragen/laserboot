% Trying to do some really simple parametric design in PostScript.
% The results are:
% - the slot is too narrow to measure what I want to measure, grabbing
%   the pieces crosswise, making a super strong joint; I had to use
%   pliers to pull the 20.3mm one out of the slot, damaging its
%   surface;
% - the 20.5 mm male tongue enters the 20 mm female slot successfully;
% - the 20.7 mm male tongue does not enter the 20 mm female slot
%   successfully;
% - in the 20mm width of the hole from which the 20mm x 30mm female piece
%   was removed, pieces up to 20.1mm fall out from either side, the
%   20.2mm piece fits snugly from either side, the 20.3mm piece fits
%   snugger, the 20.5 piece enters with great difficulty, the 20.7 mm
%   piece enters with difficulty and some damage, the 20.9mm piece
%   enters with force, leverage, and substantial damage, and the
%   21.1mm piece enters only when it's badly torn up.
% - the kerf is thicker on the front than on the back; eyeballing, I
%   think it's about 300 micro-m on the front and 100 micro-m on the back, but
%   I'll measure in photos shortly;
% - I don't have a good handle on what corner radius is being
%   achieved;
% - the kerfs do not quite close on the back at a few corners
% - the text marking was the slowest part; it demonstrates that the
%   marking line width is on the order of 100 micro-m and precision is
%   maybe 30 micro-m (again, I'll measure in photos shortly)
% - the tongues do not quite reach the bottom of the cut-through slit,
%   leaving a burned surface slightly recessed on the other side
% - the surface-engraved slit is too shallow to fit tongues into
% - there is substantial surface discoloration near the cuts from
%   smoke and/or scorching, especially on the back
% - the unpainted MDF discolors rapidly when I handle it with my dirty
%   bus hands, although less than from the smoke
% - 3mm MDF is unreasonably difficult to bend or to break with your
%   hands, and I should probably use 1mm MDF or cardboard for most
%   things, which should be cheaper too.
% - I think I can probably do a nominally 200micro-m hole with no problem
